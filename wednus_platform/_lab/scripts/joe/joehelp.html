  <H3 id=1>Introduction</H3>
  <P>
    JOE is a browser that allows to explore the internal javascript objects of 
    your browser and the html file it contains. It helps you to explore the DOM and 
    compare it in different browsers. It gives also the posibility to modify the 
    properties of JS/DOM objects. JOE 1.2 is writen in Javascript and was tested 
    with IE6, NS7 and Mozilla 1.5 under Windows XP 
  </P>
  <BR>

  <H3 id=2>Installation</H3>
  <P>
    You can download JOE and start it locally. (in IE press the rigth mouse 
    button and select Save Target As)<BR>
    <A href="joe.html">joe.html</A>
    <BR>
    You might also want to download this help file:

    <BR>
    Due to security restrictions of most browsers, you cannot debug pages which don't 
    come from the same server as JOE ist started. So if you start JOE from your 
    local hard drive you can only access files that are localy stored. If you want 
    to debug files from your web server, you must install it there. Your browser 
    will not allow you to access foreign sites on the internet. 
  </P>
  <BR>

  <H3 id=3>Debug</H3>
  <P>
    Enter a URL in the input field of the top frame. Then press return or push 
    the open button and a new window will open which contains the html file you 
    requested. In the left frame you will have a tree containing the Javascript 
    objects. Double click on a leave and it will expand or collapse. Single click on 
    a item and in the right frame you see its property details. <BR>If you select a 
    new URL in the debug window, JOE will show the new properties. You can also 
    click on an HTML item in the debug window, and JOE will show its properties 
    (without updating the object tree). 
  </P>
  <BR>

  <H3 id=4>Edit</H3>
  <P>
    You can edit the properties by entering a new value in the input fields. 
    Press return to activate it or change the focus to somewhere else to cancel. In 
    a text area use <SHIFT><RETURN>or <ALT><RETURN>instead. If a property doesn't 
    change, is this a sign, that it is read only. If you don't need the editing 
    capabilities you can turn them off in the options window. 
  </P>
  <BR>

  <H3 id=5>Options</H3>
  <P>
    Tree Frame: 
    <UL>
      <LI>all Elements shows all js properties of a js object, starting with window 
      <LI>only Objects with properties shows only objects with properties that can 
          be showed in the detail frame. So the tree frame doesn't get so crowded 
      <LI>HTML Elements shows only the objects belonging to the HTML hierarchy 
    </UL>
    Sort Order:
    <BR>
    chose your most prefered sort order for the properties
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Enable editing:
    <BR>
    if you don't wont to change properties, you 
    can turn this option off. It will be faster and less troublesom.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Enable object selection:
    <BR>
    You can click on any object in the debug window an JOE will 
    show you the properties of the object you clicked on. This might interfere with 
    other things you want to do in the debug window. It might also not work if it 
    interferes with javascript code of the debug window. So here you can turn it of.
